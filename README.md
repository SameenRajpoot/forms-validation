# Forms Validation

I have created login and signup forms using html, css and javascript. I have added validations on my form like validations for proper email format e.t.c

The error will be shown if the email is not in it's valid form i.e abcdxyz123@abcd.com and if the password contains less than 8 characters.

No error is shown for correct format

Similarly it shows errors when DOB isn't and phone number isn't added and such other fields.
